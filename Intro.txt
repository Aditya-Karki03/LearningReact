****************************Create React Projects*******************

1. React is a library
2. There are some attachments that come with react which are:
    a. React-DOM    b. React Native
3. React and React DOM used for web dev
4. React and React Native used for mobile apps
5. There are two three ways to create react project
6. NPM is Node Package Manger used to install node into systems
7. NPX is Node Package Executioner used to directly run node without installing node packages into the systems
8. The first way of creating a react project is usijng react only:
    a. npx create-react-app 01basicreact
    b. create-react-app is an utility(simply a software)
    c. This method takes lots of time to create the project
    d. It is a very bulky utility and many things that we don't want
    e. In simple terms its javascript bundle size is very big.
    f. Hence not very efficient
9. After creating the project we'll be move inside the folder "01basicreact" and do whatever needed
10. To enter into the project folder the following command is needed:
    a. cd 01basicreact
11. Now to understand any react packages or project we should always go to package.json file
12. If you move under the packages.json file you will see the follwing:
    a. name of the project
    b. version
    c. dependencies
        1. some testing library
        2. react
        3. react-DOM
        4. react-scripts
        5. web-vitals (tracks performance)
    d. scripts (this runs the project or makes it production ready)
        1. start (to run project in development environment)
        2. build 
        3. testing
        4. eject (it is used when the work with react is done and we want to move to other frameworks)
    e. eslintConfig (finds some typos/errors in the code with red line normally founds in MS DOCs)
    f. browserList
12. To run the project we've to run the start script as mentioned above in 12 d 1
13. In the 10 step we changed our directory to 01basicreact
14. Now we've to look out for package.json file in the directory using the following command
    a. dir
15. To run the start script we will run the following code:
    a. npm run start
16. The above steps will fireup a port in the browser start displaying the react logo etc.
17. In the same way if we start the build which is present inside the script as:
    a. npm run build
18. It will create a build folder which contains all the converted js & css which was written on react
19. The build folder is created because the browser does not understand react it only understands html,css and js
20. This build folder is only served to the users not the src folder
21. The above way is not a efficent way to create a react app
22. We will be using vite to create a react app, vite is a bundler
23  To create vite project the command is:  
    a. npm create vite@latest (create is an utility)
        1. Enter project name
        2. Choose the framework
        3. Select the variant (choose the lang between ts/js)
24. This are the steps of creating a vite project
25. The difference between both of the ways of creating the project is
    a. Node modules is present in non-efficent way of creating a project
    b. Whereas it is not present in the vite project
26. In the same way we will again go through the package.json file 
27. Here we've only two dependencies inside the package.json file 
    a. react
    b. react-dom
28. Here devDependencies are lot more this dependencies are used in development purpose
29. Now to run the project we need to change the directory using cd "project_Name"
30. Than we need to look out for package.json file using "dir" command
31. Since node modules are not available in the vite project we need to install it using:
    a. npm i
32.  npm run dev (will start the project) dev is inside the scripts which is inside package.json file
33  These are the some ways of creating a react project


34. After going throug pakcage.json file we should update our README.md file
35. We will be mostly working inside the src folder

***************************************Flow of React and Structure***************************
1. React is a library of js, which means majority of work is already done by react
2. Here we will be learning about how react is injected into HTML and CSS code
3. React is a core foundational library and react-dom is an implementation of react in web
4. To inject javascript into html we need to use the script tag, and there is no other way
5. For the project made using the create-react-app
    a. The node modules folder contains all the dependencies which are present in the package.json file are installed
    b. Src contains App.js and index.js
    c. gitignore, files that needs to be pushed and ignored
    d. package-lock.json same as package.json, just the dependencies gets locked and it will only run in this version
    e. Stable version of package.json is locked into package-lock.json
6. Now inside the public folder    
    a. index.html is important
    b. This is a single page and is very important aka single page application
    c. It is called SPA bc it contains only 1 html file and every work will be done on that file 
    d. If you see carefully index.html normally contains script tag, but there is no such tag here
7. Now after observing all of the above we need to move to src folder
    a. It contains a file as index.js first we need to look into that
    b. const root variable is created and initialzed it with the react-dom because
        1. Normally web also contains its dom but react also has it
        2. React-dom is aka virtual dom.
        3. Virtual dom compares with the main dom and the changes that are relevant are only done
        4. Virtual dom contains a method known as createRoot and we get the root id using js and store it into root variable
        5. We render something as App tag, there is no such tag in HTML
        6. Step 5 shows the power of react, there is something called jsx
        7. jsx used to render html element with the help of javascript
        8. jsx is similar to html
        9. The work of App tag is seen in App.js file
        10.App.js file contains a function called App which returns a h1 tag
